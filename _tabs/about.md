## Why I build this page
I mostly write my documentations, notes and everything I have learned as a developer in Obsidian.
The problem with obsidian is that I can't refer to my notes on mobile devices (_paid** subscription_), leaving me with
2 options

a. Migrate everything to Github pages (Export and done with it)

b. Selectively Rewrite and make it a journal / portfolio

<br>

I want to keep my some of my notes **private**, as they are a mess of cheatsheets and borderline plagarism. You cant publish that. This means either having to rewrite or not publish at all, *and there is **a lot** to polish*
